# Exercise 9:

# Iterate a given list and check if a given element exists as a keyâ€™s value in a dictionary. If not, delete it from the list

roll_number = [47, 64, 69, 37, 76, 83, 95, 97]
sample_dict = {'ali': 47, 'watson': 69, 'kylie': 76, 'Jackson': 97}

print("List:", roll_number)
print("Dictionary:", sample_dict)

# create new list
roll_number[:] = [item for item in roll_number if item in sample_dict.values()]
print("after removing unwanted elements from list:", roll_number)
